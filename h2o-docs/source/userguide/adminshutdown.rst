Admin Shutdown
=================


When users are finished running a particular instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O, the
program should be exited by selecting Shutdown from the Admin drop
down menu. Even if the user closes the browser window in which the 
H\ :sub:`2`\ O instance is running, without explicitly stopping 
H\ :sub:`2`\ O, the cluster associated with an H\ :sub:`2`\ O instance
still exists. The user could return to the browser based interface at
any time, and access all of the prior jobs within that instance of
H\ :sub:`2`\ O. Resources are still being allocated to H\ :sub:`2`\ O. 

In order to entirely quit an instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O and free up
the resources allocated to the program, the user may use Shutdown to 
kill the cluster.
