H\ :sub:`2`\ O installation in R Console
------------------------------------------


These instructions assume you are using R  2.14.0 or later.  

**STEP 1**

The download package containing the  H\ :sub:`2`\ O jar file can be
obtained by visiting H\ :sub:`2`\ O available downloads at 
`http://0xdata.com/downloadtable <http://0xdata.com/downloadtable/>`_.

Choose the version of  H\ :sub:`2`\ O best for you, and unzip the
downloaded H\ :sub:`2`\ O zip file. The most recent promoted build is
reccomended. 

**STEP 2**

Start an instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O. For help with this see 
:ref:`GettingStartedFromaZipFile`

Users should be aware that in order for H\ :sub:`2`\ O to successfully
run through R, an instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O must also simultaneously
be running. If the instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O is stopped, the R
program will no longer run, and work done will be lost. 

**STEP 3:**

New users may skip this step, while users who have previously
installed the  H\ :sub:`2`\ O R packages should uninstall them by entering the
following commands to the R console:  

::

   detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) 
   remove.packages("h2o") 


Note: users may get warnings of the type "Error in
detatch("package:h2o", unload = TRUE): invalid 'name' argument. 
This tells users that there is no  H\ :sub:`2`\ O package to uninstall. These
warnings can safely be ignored. 

**STEP 4:**

Install the H\ :sub:`2`\ O package, and the H\ :sub:`2`\ O client
package via the  H\ :sub:`2`\ O cran. This repository functions
exactly like the R repository, but is maintained by  H\ :sub:`2`\ O. 

::

  install.packages("h2o", repos=(c("http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-jacobi/2/R", getOption("repos"))))
 
  

**STEP 4:**

Once the  H\ :sub:`2`\ O R package has been installed, call the
package, and establish a connection to a running instance of  H\
:sub:`2`\ O. 

If there is no running instance of  H\ :sub:`2`\ O prior to using
the command "h2o.init()",  H\ :sub:`2`\ O in R will start an instance
automatically for the user. 

Note that in the call "localH2O <- h2o.init()" the h2o.init object is
being named localH2O in the R environment for use later in model
specification. Entering the call exactly as it is written below assumes the
user wishes to connect to IP localhost and port: 54321.

::

  library(h2o)
  localH2O <- h2o.init()


Users who wish to specify a connection
with a server (rather than localhost at port 54321) must explicity
state the IP address and port number in the h2o.init call. 
An example is given below, but **do not cut and paste**; users should
specify the IP and port number appropriate to their specific
environment. 

::

  library(h2o)
  localH2O = h2o.init(ip = "192.555.1.123", port = 12345, startH2O = FALSE) 


**STEP 5: Upgrading Packages**

Users may wish to manually upgrade their R packages. For instance, if
you are running the bleeding edge developer build, itâ€™s possible that
the code has changed, but that the revision number has not, in which
case manually upgrading ensures the most current version of not only
the H\ :sub:`2`\ O code, but the corresponding R code as well.

This can be done by returning to STEP 3, and following the commands
through STEP 4.
