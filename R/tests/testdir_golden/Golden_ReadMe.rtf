\
Test: glm2:1 - tests descriptive statistics for models run in R and H2O for family binomial with factors as predictor variables. \
\
Test: glm2:2 - tests coefficients for binomial GLM in R against matching coefficients in R. \
\
Test: glm2:3 - tests that when regularization is set to 0 the model returned reflects the user defined model specification. \
\
Test: glm2:4 - tests treatment of continuous real predictors in family=Gaussian\
\
Test: glm2:5 - tests treatment of factors in vanilla glm model. Note that the omitted level CAN differ, and we DO NOT expect that the coefficients are equal in that case - only that the number of coefficients is equal, and that the model descriptive statistics are equal. \
\
Test: glm2:6 tests call as.factor and vanilla poisson glm\
\
Test: glm2:7 tests tweedie dist on zero inflated poisson \
\
Test: km2:1 tests vanilla kmeans by clustering on real valued cols from iris, and comparing ordered values of within cluster ss for k=3 \
