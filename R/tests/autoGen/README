What it does:
    1. Create arbitrary munging tasks against available datasets in smalldata
        An arbitrary munging task may be:
            -A col/row slicing
            -A simple filter
            -A compound filter

    2. A simple filter is subsetting rows/cols by a single '<', '>', '=>','<=','!=','=='
    3. A compound filter is an aribtrarily complicated sequence of '!','&','|','<', '>', '=>','<=','!=','=='
