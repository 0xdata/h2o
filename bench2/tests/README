A directory of performance tests.

Each performance test is a directory of R files.
Their are at most 3 R files per test: 
    1. parsing, 
    2. modeling, 
    3. predicting, and 

Example 1:
  tests/
    gbmTest1/
      gbmTest1_Parse.R
      gbmTest1_Model.R
      gbmTest1_Predict.R

Example 2:
    tests/
      pcaTest1/
        pcaTest1_Parse.R
        pcaTest1_Model.R

Each R file sources the prologue and epilogue files from the R directory (accessible in the parent of this directory).
